== Device-specific notes

This configuration is for the retail version of PineTab, with the Feixin K101
IM2BYL02 display panel. For display to work on the early dev units with IM2BA02
panels, you need to use the correct device tree.

=== Building a full disk image

This platform uses the `u-boot` system-type. This means that a full disk image
can be produced, and this full disk image flashed _outright_ to the block
device. That block device can be the internal eMMC or the SD card.

The PineTab will boot from SD card if a bootloader can be found. This means
that the full disk image can be flashed to an SD card, and it will prioritise
booting it.

```
 $ nix-build --argstr device pine64-pinetab -A build.disk-image
 $ dd if=result of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=8M oflag=sync,direct status=progress
```

=== Building the boot partition

Building the full disk image may require a native AArch64 system.

The boot partition can be built, and then flashed on top of an existing Mobile
NixOS boot partition.

```
 $ nix-build --argstr device pine64-pinetab -A build.boot-partition
 $ dd if=result/mobile-nixos-boot.img of=/dev/mmcblkXp3 bs=8M oflag=sync,direct status=progress
```

=== Building U-Boot

Mobile NixOS is not managing platform firmware builds anymore.

PineTab support in Tow-Boot [is planned](https://github.com/Tow-Boot/Tow-Boot/issues/144).
