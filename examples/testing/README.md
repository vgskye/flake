Testing examples
================

These examples are made specifically to test features.

They are not to be used as a normal system, as they likely have some fatal
flaws, either usability-wise (e.g. not usable at all) or security-wise (e.g.
default passwords).

More details are available inside each testing systems directories.

Though, please refer to those systems as reference implementation for
validating changes around their features under test!
