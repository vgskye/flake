= Kernel configuration

This directory holds the *suggested* kernel configuration.

This is used by the `bin/kernel-normalize*` helpers.

In your systems, feel free to override any of those with what you prefer.

The **required** options are found in `modules/kernel-config.nix`.

== Goals

The goals for these options are as follow:

 * Remove all unneeded options to reduce compilation time
 * Select the appropriate defaults

A device can change the options as needed.
