= About Mobile NixOS
include::_support/common.inc[]

Mobile NixOS is a superset on top of link:https://nixos.org/nixos/[NixOS Linux]
link:https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/[Nixpkgs] and link:https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix],
aiming to abstract away the differences between _mobile_ devices.

In four words: _“NixOS, on your phone”_.


== Goals

The goal is to get a NixOS system running on mobile devices, e.g. Android
phones.

This is intended as building blocks, allowing the end-users to configure their
systems as desired.

The amount of targeted devices does not dilute or devalue the work. It's the
other way around, it increases the odds that people will start using the
project and contribute back.


== Prior work and thanks

This project initially borrowed and relied on the hard work from the
link:https://postmarketos.org/[PostmarketOS project]. They are forever
thanked in their efforts.
