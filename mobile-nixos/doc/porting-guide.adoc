= Device Porting Guide
include::_support/common.inc[]

NOTE: This subject needs to be expanded upon.

In a nutshell, the basic steps are:

* Preparing the device for development use (unlocking the bootloader).
* Finding appropriate the sources (mainly the kernel).
* Writing the expressions to build said sources.

== Kernel configuration

The kernel can be configured using a helper command, assuming you are at the
root of the repo. (Replace `$device_name` with the correct name.)

```
 $ bin/menuconfig $device_name
```

When importing a configuration from another source, manually editing the kernel
configuration, or updating the kernel version, it is recommended to run the
kernel configuration normalization helper, too.

```
 $ bin/kernel-normalize-config $device_name
```
