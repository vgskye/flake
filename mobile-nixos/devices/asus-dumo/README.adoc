== Device-specific notes

=== Developer mode

For more details the link:https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/debug_buttons.md#Firmware-Menu-Interface[
Firmware Menu Interface] section from the upstream documentation can be read.

You will need to:

. Boot in _Recovery mode_ by powering on using `Power` + `Volume-Up` + `Volume-Down`
. Activate Developer mode by pressing `Volume-Up` and `Volume-Down` simultaneously

Note that this is only to allow you to boot unverified images.

You might want to configure other options with GBB flags, left as an
exercise to the reader.
