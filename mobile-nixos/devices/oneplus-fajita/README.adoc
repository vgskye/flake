== Device-specific notes

=== First time setup notes

==== Update firmware

Make sure your device was updated to the latest OxygenOS 11. It may not be
required, but this will reduce disparities.

Make sure the firmware partitions are consistent by using a recovery to flash
`copy-partitions-*.zip` as described in the installation instructions of
LineageOS

- https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/fajita/install#ensuring-all-firmware-partitions-are-consistent

Again, it may not be strictly required, but this ensures a coherent single set
of firmwares are present on-device where relevant. This is important as it is
possible to have different versions flashed to different slots. This is why so
many persons online have “only one slot that works”.


==== Prepare for mainline

[NOTE]
====
This assumes the phone will only run SDM845 mainline images.
====

You will need to erase the `dtbo` partitions for either slots.

```
 $ fastboot erase dtbo_a
 $ fastboot erase dtbo_b
```


==== Dual booting

This is not supported. Refer to other non-Android Linux instructions and
adapt as needed. Here be snapdragons.
