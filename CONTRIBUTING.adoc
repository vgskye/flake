the same with Mobile NixOS.


== Opening issues

Issues you face when using or working with Mobile NixOS should be filed on
link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/issues[the project's issue tracker].

First verify an existing, open, and recent issue matching your exact problem
doesn't already exist. In case of doubt, always open a new issue. Sometimes
vaguely reported symptoms are from different sources and it is easier to manage
when different issues are opened.

When describing the issues you face, please provide the most information you
can. For sharing logs, please share them as link:https://gist.github.com/[Gists]
